# taggr

Just a little playground app to experiment with web technologies on the desktop.  
The UI is built with React, Material-UI and Webpack.  
My main goal was to create an ID3 editor which is more tailored to my own workflow and does exactly what I need with as few keystrokes as possible.  
And here it is, in all its glory:

## Features

- Load existing ID3 tags
- Copy song title from file name, controllable with regexp
- Auto numbering w/o leading zeroes
