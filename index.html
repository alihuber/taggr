<!-- @babel/core -->
<!-- This package, as the name would suggest, is the core package. The package is responsible for compiling javascript code and outputting usable code. By default it uses your local configuration, but we will get into that later on. -->

<!-- @babel/register -->
<!-- This package will enable us to use new features of javascript in our Webpack config. So not only the code we are going to output runs through Babel, but our javascript config files for Webpack will run through it as well. -->

<!-- @babel/preset-env -->
<!-- Knowing what browser supports what javascript feature is essential in transforming your code. Here is where preset-env comes in. It handles what transforms should be applied, based on your own input. You tell Babel: “I need support for these browsers” and it will transform your javascript so it will work on the list you provide. -->

<!-- @babel/polyfill -->
<!-- Sometimes the browsers you want to support need a little extra help for certain features. @babel/polyfill will provide polyfills for those featured, based on what browsers you wish to support. -->

<!-- babel-loader -->
<!-- Since we will be using Webpack, this package allows us to transpile our code using Babel and Webpack. -->

<!-- You can also use new javascript features in your webpack.config.js thanks to the @babel/register-package we installed earlier. The only thing you have to do, is change your name from webpack.config.js to webpack.config.babel.js. -->
